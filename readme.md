A vision of web page styling.
========================================

* I will use inline block A tags exclusively.
We attempt to expand clickable areas.

* I will use complex effects as the style keystone.
Every clickable or otherwise important element will respond to hovers impressively.

* I will use thinly framed rectangular blocks exclusively.

* Nothing moves. Nothing changes color.
I will use fade, transparency and shadow. To move something, fade it out first.

TODO:
-----

* No scroll.
* No flow.
* No selection on active elements.
